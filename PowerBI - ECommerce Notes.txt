In 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈, a field parameter is not a built-in feature or functionality. However, you can achieve similar functionality using different techniques available in Power BI. Here are a few approaches:

❇ 𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐫: You can use a slicer visual in Power BI to allow users to select a parameter value. Create a slicer based on the field you want to use as a parameter. Users can then interactively select a value from the slicer, which will filter the data accordingly.

❇ 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐅 𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐂𝐇 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: You can create measures that dynamically change their calculations based on a parameter value. Use the IF or SWITCH functions within the measure to conditionally calculate results based on the selected parameter value. Users can change the parameter value using slicers or other filter visuals.

❇ 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Power BI allows you to define custom functions using the Power Query Editor. You can create a custom function that takes a parameter as an input and applies specific transformations or calculations to the data based on that parameter value.

❇ 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: Power Query in Power BI allows you to define parameters that can be used to dynamically modify data sources, queries, or calculations. You can define a parameter within Power Query and reference it in your data transformations or queries. Users can change the parameter value using the Power BI Desktop interface.
